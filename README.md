# block21_PartyPlanner

Build your website according to this user story:

A user enters the website and finds a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all the parties that are happening.
Next to each party in the list is a delete button. The user clicks the delete button for one of the parties. That party is then removed from the list.
There is also a form that allows the user to enter information about a new party that they want to schedule. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user observes their party added to the list of parties.
